Core focus:

- Future proof

- Better dev experience for us
- Better dev experience for customers

## Quick overview of packages

- Core package
- Evm package
- Server package
- Connectors package
- EvmApi package
- Utils

## Still todo

- Sol authentication
- Sol api
- Password authentication
- Web3+Sol util function like executefunction
- Better/faster building (esbuild/rollup/webpack)
- Building for react-native, nodejs, cdn and make sure compadible with react-moralis, cra, nextjs, vite etc.
- CI/CD
- Go through all use cases and make sure it is all covered
